## Annotation Rules

### What to Annotate
- **License plates** visible in GTA V screenshots
- All characters on the plate must be readable (or partially readable)
- Both front and rear license plates should be annotated

### Bounding Box Requirements

#### ‚úÖ Correct Bounding Boxes:
- **Tight fit:** Box should closely surround the license plate
- **Minimum padding:** 2-3 pixels around all edges
- **Include entire plate:** All characters must be within the box
- **Rectangular shape:** Follow the plate's rectangular outline
- **No rotation:** Use axis-aligned rectangles (Label Studio doesn't support rotated boxes)

#### ‚ùå Incorrect Bounding Boxes:
- Too loose (excessive padding > 10 pixels)
- Too tight (cutting off parts of the plate)
- Including too much of the vehicle bumper
- Missing characters at the edges
- Overlapping with other objects unnecessarily

### Label Classes
- **Single class only:** `license_plate`
- Do not create additional labels or categories
- All annotations should use the same class

### Special Cases

#### Multiple Plates in One Image:
- **Annotate all visible plates** if they meet quality criteria
- Each plate gets its own bounding box
- Example: If you can see both front and rear plates, annotate both

#### Partially Occluded Plates:
- **Annotate the visible portion only**
- If less than 50% of the plate is visible, consider skipping
- Use your judgment: if text is readable, annotate it

#### Blurry or Low-Quality Plates:
- **Skip images** where the plate is too blurry to identify characters
- If at least 50% of characters are distinguishable, annotate it
- Mark questionable images for review (use comments feature)

#### Distant/Small Plates:
- **Annotate if characters are visible** when zoomed in
- Use Label Studio's zoom feature to verify visibility
- Skip if plate is too small (< 20 pixels in either dimension)

---

## Quality Guidelines

### Annotation Quality Standards

#### High-Quality Annotation:
- Bounding box tightly fits the plate
- All characters are fully contained
- No excessive background included
- Consistent padding (2-3 pixels)
- Correct label class applied

#### What to Avoid:
- Inconsistent box sizes (sometimes loose, sometimes tight)
- Cutting off parts of characters
- Including large portions of vehicle body
- Forgetting to annotate secondary plates in the same image
- Using wrong label class

### Consistency Tips
- **Zoom in** to verify character visibility before annotating
- **Check your previous annotations** to maintain consistency
- **Take breaks** every 30-60 minutes to maintain focus
- **Review your work** before submitting a batch

### When to Skip an Image
- License plate is completely obscured
- Image is too dark/bright to see the plate
- Plate is too blurry (characters not distinguishable)
- Severe motion blur
- Plate is too small (< 20 pixels)

**Note:** Mark skipped images with a comment explaining why (e.g., "plate not visible", "too blurry")

---

## Workflow

### Step-by-Step Annotation Process

#### 1. Review Image
- **Examine the image** for visible license plates
- Use **zoom** (scroll wheel) if needed to see details
- **Pan** (click and drag) to navigate around large images
- Identify all license plates that meet annotation criteria

#### 2. Draw Bounding Box
- Click the **"Rectangle"** tool in the toolbar
- Click and drag to draw a box around the license plate
- **Adjust corners** by dragging to fit tightly
- Ensure 2-3 pixels padding around the plate edges

#### 3. Verify Annotation
- **Double-check** that all characters are within the box
- Verify the box is tight (not too loose or too tight)
- Confirm the correct label class is applied: `license_plate`
- If multiple plates exist, ensure all are annotated

#### 4. Add Comments (Optional)
- Click **"Add comment"** for questionable cases
- Examples:
  - "Partially occluded - only annotated visible portion"
  - "Low confidence - characters barely visible"
  - "Multiple plates - annotated both front and rear"

#### 5. Submit Annotation
- Click **"Submit"** button (or press `Ctrl+Enter`)
- Annotation is saved and next image loads automatically

#### 6. Track Progress
- Monitor the progress bar at the top
- Review your annotations periodically for consistency
- Take breaks to maintain annotation quality

## Keyboard Shortcuts

### Essential Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Ctrl + Enter` | Submit annotation and move to next image |
| `Ctrl + Backspace` | Delete selected bounding box |
| `Ctrl + Z` | Undo last action |
| `Ctrl + Shift + Z` | Redo action |
| `Space` | Pan mode toggle |
| `+` or `=` | Zoom in |
| `-` or `_` | Zoom out |
| `0` | Reset zoom to 100% |

### Navigation Shortcuts
| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt + Left Arrow` | Previous image |
| `Alt + Right Arrow` | Next image |
| `Esc` | Cancel current annotation |

### Tips for Efficiency
- Learn and use shortcuts to speed up annotation
- Use `Space` to quickly switch between pan and select modes

## Export Instructions

### When to Export
- After completing a batch of 20-50 annotations
- Before taking a long break
- When ready to train/fine-tune the model
- Regularly for backup purposes

### Export Steps

#### 1. Access Export Menu
- Click **"Export"** button in the project view
- Select export format

#### 2. Choose Format
- **Select:** `YOLO` format
- This will generate:
  - `classes.txt` - List of label classes
  - `notes.json` - Annotation metadata
  - Individual `.txt` files for each image with normalized coordinates

#### 3. Configure Export Options
- ‚úÖ **Include images:** Check this option to export images along with annotations
- ‚úÖ **Include label info:** Include class names
- Export to: `datasets/lpr/` directory

#### 4. Download and Organize
```
datasets/lpr/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ train/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image1.txt
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ image2.txt
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ valid/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ labels/
```

#### 5. Verify Export
- Check that `.txt` files contain normalized coordinates (0-1 range)
- Format: `<class_id> <x_center> <y_center> <width> <height>`
- Example: `0 0.512 0.723 0.089 0.045`
- Ensure all annotated images have corresponding label files

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Label Studio won't start
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if port 8080 is already in use
netstat -ano | findstr :8080

# If in use, stop the process or use a different port
label-studio start --port 8090
```

#### Issue: Images not loading
**Solution:**
- Check image file paths are correct
- Ensure images are in a supported format (.jpg, .png)
- Verify Label Studio has read permissions for the image directory
- Try re-importing the dataset

#### Issue: Cannot draw bounding boxes
**Solution:**
- Ensure you're in annotation mode (not review mode)
- Check that the Rectangle tool is selected
- Refresh the page and try again
- Clear browser cache if problem persists

#### Issue: Annotations not saving
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure stable internet connection
- Try using a different browser (Chrome/Firefox recommended)
- Export current work as backup

#### Issue: Lost annotations
**Solution:**
- Check the "Annotations" tab in the project
- Use the export feature to recover data
- Enable auto-save if available in settings

### Performance Tips
- **Close unused browser tabs** to free up memory
- **Use Chrome or Firefox** for best performance
- **Annotate in batches** (20-50 images at a time)
- **Export regularly** to avoid data loss
