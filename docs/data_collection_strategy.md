## 4. Manual Data Collection Procedure

### 4.1 Pre-Collection Setup

**Step 1: Configure GTA V Settings**
- Graphics: High quality (better plate readability)
- Resolution: 1920x1080 or higher
- Anti-aliasing: Enabled (smoother text)
- Disable HUD (F1 or through settings)

**Step 2: Choose Collection Location**
- **Recommended Locations:**
  - Los Santos International Airport (open space, good lighting)
  - Rockford Hills (residential, varied angles)
  - Del Perro Freeway (highway scenarios)
  - Vespucci Beach parking lots (stationary vehicles)

**Step 3: Start Recording Software**
- Configure settings as per Section 3
- Test recording quality before main collection
- Verify disk space (20-50 GB per hour of footage)

### 4.2 Collection Workflow

**Phase 1: Stationary Vehicle Capture (Easier)**

1. Find parked vehicles or spawn traffic
2. Approach vehicle from various angles
3. Use character camera controls:
   - Right mouse button: Hold to look around
   - Mouse movement: Adjust angle
   - Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out (if supported by mods)
4. Capture 3-5 seconds at each angle
5. Move to next vehicle

**Target:** 20-30 vehicles per 30-minute session

**Phase 2: Moving Vehicle Capture (More Challenging)**

1. Position character near traffic flow
2. Observe approaching vehicles
3. Follow vehicle with camera
4. Capture 5-10 seconds of footage
5. Use cinematic camera (V key) for smooth tracking

**Target:** 10-15 vehicles per 30-minute session

**Phase 3: Environmental Variations**

1. Change time of day:
   - Quick method: Save game, reload at different time
   - Manual method: Wait in-game (1 min real = 2 hours in-game)
   
2. Change weather:
   - Method 1: Wait for natural weather change
   - Method 2: Use cheat codes (if enabled):
     ```
     ~  (open console)
     makeitrain  (rain)
     ```

3. Capture same scenarios under new conditions

### 4.3 Quality Checklist

For each captured clip, verify:
- [ ] License plate clearly visible in frame
- [ ] Plate is in focus (not blurry)
- [ ] Adequate lighting (text readable)
- [ ] Minimal motion blur
- [ ] At least 3 seconds of usable footage
- [ ] Metadata recorded (time, weather, angle)

### 4.4 Session Planning

**Week 1 Target: 100-200 images**

**Session 1 (2 hours): Day + Clear Weather**
- Location: Airport + Freeway
- Focus: Front and rear angles
- Target: 50 vehicles

**Session 2 (1.5 hours): Night + Clear Weather**
- Location: Downtown + Beach
- Focus: Artificial lighting scenarios
- Target: 30 vehicles

**Session 3 (1 hour): Various Weather**
- Capture rain, overcast conditions
- Various angles
- Target: 20 vehicles

**Total Time Investment: 4.5 hours for initial dataset**

## 5. Frame Extraction Strategy

### 5.1 Extraction Parameters

**Frame Rate:**
- Source video: 60 FPS
- Extraction rate: 5-10 FPS (every 6-12 frames)
- Rationale: Reduce redundant frames, keep diversity

**Quality:**
- Format: PNG or JPEG
- Quality: 95% (JPEG) or lossless (PNG)
- Resolution: Original (1920x1080)

**Naming Convention:**
```
{video_filename_base}_{frame_number}.jpg

Examples:
day_clear_01_00123.jpg
night_rain_03_00456.jpg
```

This convention uses the base name of the source video file, ensuring that frames are easily traceable to their original clip.

### 5.2 Automated Extraction Script

**Script:** `scripts/extract_frames.py`

**Pseudocode:**
```python
def extract_frames(video_path, output_dir, fps=5, quality=95):
    # Load video using OpenCV
    video = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    source_fps = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS)
    frame_interval = int(source_fps / fps)
    
    video_filename_base = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(video_path))[0]
    frame_count = 0
    extracted_count = 0
    
    while True:
        ret, frame = video.read()
        if not ret:
            break
        
        # Extract every Nth frame
        if frame_count % frame_interval == 0:
            # Generate filename from video name and frame number
            filename = f"{video_filename_base}_{extracted_count:05d}.jpg"
            filepath = os.path.join(output_dir, filename)
            
            # Save frame
            cv2.imwrite(filepath, frame, [cv2.IMWRITE_JPEG_QUALITY, quality])
            extracted_count += 1
        
        frame_count += 1
    
    video.release()
    return extracted_count
```

**Usage:**
```bash
python scripts/extract_frames.py --input raw_footage/day_clear/day_clear_01.mp4 \
                                  --output datasets/lpr/train/images/ \
                                  --fps 5 \
                                  --quality 95
```

### 5.3 Manual Frame Selection (Alternative)

For higher quality curation:
1. Use VLC Media Player or similar tool
2. Play video at slow speed (0.25x)
3. Pause on frames with clear plate visibility
4. Press Shift+S to save frame
5. Manually rename and organize

**Trade-off:** Higher quality but more time-consuming (10-15 images/hour vs. 100+ with automation)

---

## 6. Quality Assurance

### 6.1 Image Quality Criteria

**Include:**
- Plate clearly visible and in-focus
- Text readable (at least 4-5 characters identifiable)
- Adequate contrast between plate and background
- Minimal motion blur
- Plate occupies at least 20x50 pixels

**Exclude:**
- Extremely blurry images
- Plate too small (< 15x30 pixels)
- Severe occlusion (> 50% of plate hidden)
- Corrupted or distorted frames
- Duplicate or near-duplicate frames

### 6.2 Annotation Workflow

**Tool:** Label Studio (already in requirements.txt)

1. Import extracted images
2. Configure YOLO format annotation
3. Draw bounding boxes around plates
4. Export in YOLO format to datasets/lpr/

**Quality Control:**
- Double-check annotations for accuracy
- Verify normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0)
- Ensure one annotation per file
- Review annotations periodically
